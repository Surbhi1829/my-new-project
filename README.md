# Painting with AI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This is a course project dedicated to exploring and implementing a specific Artificial Intelligence technique to innovate or assist in the field of digital painting and art creation.


## How is it used?

The "Painting with AI" solution is an intuitive tool designed to transform conceptual ideas into digital art almost instantly. The process of using it is simple:

    Input the Vision: The user accesses the application and enters a detailed text prompt describing the image they want (e.g., "A neon-lit cyberpunk street with flying cars, highly realistic digital painting").

    Generate: The user clicks the 'Generate' button. The underlying AI model (a generative model) processes the text prompt, translating it into a unique visual composition, style, and color palette.

    Download/Iterate: Within seconds, the AI presents the generated artwork. The user can either download the image or refine their initial prompt (e.g., by adding "Van Gogh style" or "darker tones") to generate endless variations until they achieve their desired result.

Situations and Environment

This solution is needed whenever there is a demand for rapid visual content creation or creative conceptualization without the time, budget, or skills required for traditional art.

    Environment: It is designed to be used in any digital environment, such as a web browser or a dedicated desktop application.

    Time: It excels in situations demanding fast prototyping, such as client pitches, tight content deadlines, and creative brainstorming sessions where instant visualization is key.

Who are the Users?

The tool is built for a wide range of users, bridging the gap between imagination and visualization:

    Concept Artists & Designers: They use it to quickly generate reference images, explore complex scenes, and overcome creative block.

    Writers & Storytellers: They use it to visualize characters, settings, and scenes for their books or scripts.

    Marketing & Content Creators: They use it to generate unique, copyright-free imagery for social media, blogs, and ad campaigns.

    Hobbyists & General Users: Anyone without drawing skills who wants to bring their imaginative ideas to life instantly for personal use.

User Needs to Consider

The solution is designed to be highly accessible, prioritizing an intuitive interface where natural language (text) is the primary input, while ensuring the output quality is high enough for professional or personal use.

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
